# Botkugo
Small personal Discord bot

## Requirements
This bot uses the discord.py 2.1.0 bot framework, which requires Python 3.8+. Install using `python3 -m pip install discord.py` in your virtual environment.

## Bot Setup
Visit [the Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and if you haven't, set up an application, then a bot for that application. As this bot is planned for use on a very small number of servers, I have opted to request privileged intents, which you will need to enable on the develper page. On the bot page, get your token, and paste it into the config.py file. Then run botkugo.py in your environment of choice.
