# Botkugo
Small personal Discord bot

## Requirements
This bot uses the discord.py 2.1.0 bot framework, which requires Python 3.8+. Install using `python3 -m pip install discord.py` in your virtual environment.

## Bot Setup
Visit [the Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and if you haven't, set up an application, then a bot for that application. On the bot page, get your token, and paste it into the config.py file. Then run botkugo.py in your environment of choice.
